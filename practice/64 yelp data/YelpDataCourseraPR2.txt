Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet
https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science/supplement/VSJ29/yelp-dataset-sql-lookup

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 (select count(*) from attribute)
ii. Business table = 10000 (select count(*) from business)
iii. Category table = 10000 (select count(*) from category)
iv. Checkin table = 10000 (select count(*) from checkin)
v. elite_years table = 10000 (select count(*) from elite_years)
vi. friend table = 10000 (select count(*) from friend)
vii. hours table = 10000 (select count(*) from hours)
viii. photo table = 10000 (select count(*) from photo)
ix. review table = 10000 (select count(*) from review)
x. tip table = 10000 (select count(*) from tip)
xi. user table = 10000 (select count(*) from user)



2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (select count(id) from business)
ii. Hours = 1562 (select count(distinct business_id) from hours)
iii. Category = 2643 (select count(distinct business_id) from category)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (select count(distinct business_id) from attribute)
v. Review = 10000 (select count(id) from review)
vi. Checkin = 493 (select count(distinct business_id) from checkin)
vii. Photo = 10000 (select count(id) from photo)
viii. Tip = 537 (select count(distinct user_id) from tip)
            3979 (select count(distinct business_id) from tip)
ix. User = 10000 (select count(id) from user)
x. Friend = 11 (select count(distinct user_id) from friend)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (select count(distinct user_id) from elite_years)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

6. Find the distribution of star ratings to the business in the following cities:

i. Avon

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select stars, count(*) as count from review 
	where business_id in (select id from business where city = 'Avon')
	group by stars order by stars

	Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):
	+-------+-------+
	| stars | count |
	+-------+-------+
	+-------+-------+
	(Zero rows)

ii. Beachwood

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select stars, count(*) as count from review 
	where business_id in (select id from business where city = 'Beachwood')
	group by stars order by stars

	Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):
	+-------+-------+
	| stars | count |
	+-------+-------+
	|     3 |     1 |
	+-------+-------+	


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select name, review_count from user order by review_count desc limit 3
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+--------+--------------+
	| name   | review_count |
	+--------+--------------+
	| Gerald |         2000 |
	| Sara   |         1629 |
	| Yuri   |         1339 |
	+--------+--------------+	


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	It seems that there's no apparent correlation between these two variables.
	From the results of the following query we can see that, for example:
	Mimi has 968 reviews and 497 fans. Gerald - 2000 and 253 accordingly.
	So, Mimi has twice less reviews, but twice more fans than Gerald.
	But we also cannot say that there's some negative correlation here.
	
	SQL code:
	select name, review_count, fans from user order by review_count desc limit 10
	
	The Result:
	+-----------+--------------+------+
	| name      | review_count | fans |
	+-----------+--------------+------+
	| Gerald    |         2000 |  253 |
	| Sara      |         1629 |   50 |
	| Yuri      |         1339 |   76 |
	| .Hon      |         1246 |  101 |
	| William   |         1215 |  126 |
	| Harald    |         1153 |  311 |
	| eric      |         1116 |   16 |
	| Roanna    |         1039 |  104 |
	| Mimi      |          968 |  497 |
	| Christine |          930 |  173 |
	+-----------+--------------+------+

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: 'love' (1780 vs 232)
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select count(*) as love from review where text like '%love%'
	select count(*) as hate from review where text like '%hate%'
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select name, fans from user order by fans desc limit 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+-----------+------+
	| name      | fans |
	+-----------+------+
	| Amy       |  503 |
	| Mimi      |  497 |
	| Harald    |  311 |
	| Gerald    |  253 |
	| Christine |  173 |
	| Lisa      |  159 |
	| Cat       |  133 |
	| William   |  126 |
	| Fran      |  124 |
	| Lissa     |  120 |
	+-----------+------+
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SQL code used for analysis:

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
