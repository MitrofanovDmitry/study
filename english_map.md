**Pronunciation**

IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)  


Pace of speech  
• 150 words/min   
   (2.5 words/sec)  
• No pauses between words      
  (stretching vowels)  


Place of Articulation  
• bilabial - made with both lips  
• labiodental - articulated with the lower lip and the upper teeth  
• dental - articulated with the tongue against the upper teeth  
• alveolar - articulated with the tongue against the alveolar ridge  
• palatal - produced by raising the blade, or front, of the tongue toward or against the hard palate just behind the alveolar ridge (the gums)  
• velar - pronounced with the back part of the tongue against the soft palate (the velum)  
• glottal - produced by obstructing airflow in the vocal tract (or, more precisely, the glottis)  


Manner of Articulation  
• stop - at the beginning the tongue or lips briefly block the air from leaving the vocal tract  
• fricative - produced by bringing the mouth into position to block the passage of the airstream, but not making complete closure, so that air moving through the mouth generates audible friction  
• affricate - begins as a stop and releases as a fricative  
• nasal - produced with a lowered velum, allowing air to escape freely through the nose  
• liquid - the tongue produces a partial closure in the mouth, resulting in a resonant, vowel-like consonant  
• glide - phonetically similar to a vowel sound but functions as the syllable boundary  


Phonation  
• voiceless - the vocal cords do not vibrate while producing it  
• voiced - the vocal cords vibrate while producing it
